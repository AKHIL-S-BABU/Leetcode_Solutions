Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, 
compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9


arr=[3,1,2,4,0,1,3,2]
left=[]
right=[]
for i in range(len(arr)):
    m=max(arr[:i+1])
    n=max(arr[len(arr)-(i+1):])
    left.append(m)
    right.append(n)
right=right[::-1]
print(left)
print(right)
sum=0
for i in range(len(arr)):
    a=min(left[i],right[i])
    b=a-arr[i]
    sum=sum+b
print(sum)
